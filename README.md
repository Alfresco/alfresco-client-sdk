# Alfresco Digital Business Platform - Java Client (Early Access)

## Introduction
This project contains Java lib projects to consume easily **Alfresco Digital Business Platform Public REST API** including **Alfresco Content Services**, **Alfresco Process Services**, **Alfresco Governance Services** and **Activiti**.

It include a set of APIs that allows developers to quickly build Alfresco-enabled Java & Android applications. 

Those projects are currently the foundation of our major next version of [Alfresco Android APP](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-android-app) available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.alfresco.mobile.android.application)

## Important Notice

Alfresco Digital Business Platform Java Client is currently in **Early Access mode**. It evolves as you use them, as you give feedback, and as the developers update and add file. We like to think app & lib development as services that grow and evolve with the involvement of the community.

If you are a developer trying to interact with more than one Alfresco Services have a look to **[Alfresco Platform Client](client-java/alfresco-platform-client)**
